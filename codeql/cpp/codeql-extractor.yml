    title: Value to scale compiler introspection timeouts with
    description: >
      The extractor attempts to determine what compiler the source code being extracted
      is compiled with. To this end the extractor makes additional calls to the compiler,
      some of which are expected to return within a certain fixed time (either 10s or 15s).
      On some systems that are under high load this time might be too short, and can be
      scaled up using this option.
